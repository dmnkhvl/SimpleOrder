## First time installation

### Install latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Install all packages from `package.json` locally

    npm install

### Development

    npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

### Build

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
